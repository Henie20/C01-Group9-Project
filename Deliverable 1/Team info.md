<br /> I am a third year student in the Computer Science (Software Engineering Specialist) program at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I have experience working as an IT QA Assistant for the Ministry of Education in a team that adapted scrum project management techniques. During this experience I gained familiarity with several testing methods including: regression testing,  requirement testing, acceptance testing, internal structure testing, integration testing, and usability testing. My team utilized Azure Devops to manage work items and other aspects of the project. I am familiar with programming in Java, C, Python, JavaScript. Iâ€™m also familiar with SQL.
