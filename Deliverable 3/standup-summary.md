|thelittlebigz|Yesterday / this morning, finished and uploaded the modified AndroidManifest that allows for the app to be set as a launcher and added a component that should launch apps with a button click I also created an example page for testing  Issues: I was having trouble running the dev branch on my local machine so I can't verify if there's any bugs in my code as is but will try to debug the issues within my machine or attempt to run on a separate machine figure that out|
|papichul0s|I also need to check it on an android because they have different implementations|
|henie5097|Yesterday: implemented internal fontsize changes that align with the dynamic styling|
