Summary of Group Feedback: 

What went well:
-We were better at planning our sprint so that the majority of user stories were complete
-We starting merging our feature branches into dev, following CI
-We are doing well in terms of how much work is left for the final sprint

What we could do better:
-Not everything is being tested yet, but we should have tests for all the current features before adding more
-We should be better about sending our daily standups everyday
-We should try to finish remaining feature stories by this Sunday so we have enough time to finish testing and cleaning up the UI
