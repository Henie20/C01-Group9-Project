Summary of Group Feedback: 

I think we could have better communication and if anyone is gonna miss a meeting we should give each other at least 24 hours notice. Also we should make sure to send our daily standups and know that sending nothing on a day implies that we haven't worked on it. We also should've maybe re-evaluated the sprint workload halfway through since we didn't finish all of the user stories we'd intended to.
