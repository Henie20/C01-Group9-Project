|Zeeshan Badr|Yesterday/today: spent most of last night / this morning working on the launcher so we can launch apps only now realizing the reason it was causing such an issue was because of Expo all their react native libraries that are able to launch apps and do other things with the launcher don't work with Expo which was the root of the issue in hindsight should have seen this earlier but here we are what I've done to combat that is I've added code that will work once / if our project is compiled as an EAS build and installed on an Android phone using Expos linking API where each button links to an apps "URL" which is then opened the only problem is this will not work in a sandbox environment like Expo go and must be done through a standalone expo app such as an EAS build later on today will take another look at the voice assistant and tying it in with speech to text and text to speech|2024-03-29T08:42:27.318000+00:00|
